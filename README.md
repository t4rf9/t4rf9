- 👋 Hi, I’m @t4rf9
- 🌱 I’m currently an undergraduate student in Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University; I was an FJSDFZer.
So I just have a little knowledge of most fields which are part of a CS undergraduate program, but am not professional in most specific fields.
- 👀 I’m interested in deep learning on computational psychology and image/video processing, computer graphics, etc.
- 💞️ I’m curious about all exciting new things, especially those with great influences to the human society or astonishing visual and aural effects!
- 📫 Contact me via t4rf9@163.com or lin-zx18@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn
